# ROCK_PAPER_SCISSOR_GAME
I made this project using html,css and java script. I got this project from my senior of my club Student Alumni Interaction(SAI) Cell.
I learn to use Array and making computer to choose any element from the given Array using Math.floor and Math.random() which is the essential part to make this game work.
