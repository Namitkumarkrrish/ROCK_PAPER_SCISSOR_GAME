# ROCK_PAPER_SCISSOR_GAME

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I made this project as part of my learning journey and got inspiration from my senior at the **Student Alumni Interaction (SAI) Cell**.

## Features
- User can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
- The computer randomly selects an option using `Math.random()`.
- Uses arrays and JavaScript logic for game mechanics.

## What I Learned
- How to use **Arrays** in JavaScript.
- How to generate random choices using `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()`.
- Basic DOM manipulation to update the game UI.
